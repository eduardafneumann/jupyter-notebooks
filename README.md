# Jupyter notebooks

This repository contains some jupyter notebooks that deal with data science, statistical analysis and numerical methods.

## Overview

### Sklearn scripts

These notebooks use the sklearn library to deal with clustering, using KMeans, and classification, using MLPClassifier and RandomForestClassifier, problems.

### Statistical analysis

These notebooks analise a hipotetical electoral survey and conducts some hypothesis test on this cenario.

### Numeric methods

These notebooks implements and apply numeric methods to a variety of cenarios.

## Run notebooks

### Create virtual environment

Run 'python3 -m venv venv' to create a virtual environment, run 'source venv/bin/activate' to activate it, and 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install dependencies.

### Run jupyter notebooks

Once with the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run 'jupyter notebook' to initiate the jupyter server. Once the interface opens in your browser, you can run and interact with the notebooks from there.
